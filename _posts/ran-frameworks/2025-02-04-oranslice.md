ORANSlice is an end-to-end open-source 5G network slicing framework for O-RAN. 
It (i) extends the 5G protocol stacks of OpenAirInterface (OAI) to support RAN slicing; (ii) implements an E2SM-CCC-based Service Model (SM) and xApp for RAN slicing control; and (iii) conducts extensive testing and validation on the [Arena](/experimental-platforms/arena) and <a href="https://x5g.org/" target="_blank">X5G</a> testbeds to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the implementation.

The ORANSlice framework is shown in the diagram below.
