Open Radio Access Networks (RAN) are revolutionizing the telecommunications industry by introducing disaggregated, programmable components and open interfaces. 
However, despite their promise, existing architectures lack robust support for real-time control, limiting their ability to address latency-sensitive operations effectively.
To bridge this gap, we propose dApps—lightweight applications deployed directly on RAN nodes. 
Designed to extend the O-RAN architecture into real-time and user-plane domains, dApps overcome privacy and timing constraints by accessing data unavailable to traditional controllers. This enables them to execute control actions within sub-millisecond intervals, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing network slicing, scheduling, and resource management.
To showcase the potential of dApps, we developed an open-source framework built on OpenAirInterface (OAI). 
This framework includes a reference architecture for dApps, covering their lifecycle from deployment to real-time interactions with RAN nodes. 
We also introduced the E3 interface, a communication protocol that integrates dApps with the broader O-RAN ecosystem, allowing seamless collaboration with other applications like xApps and rApps.
Our framework has been validated in real-world 5G scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time control loops. 
Key use cases, such as spectrum sharing and user positioning, achieved control latencies below one millisecond, paving the way for intelligent, scalable, and efficient Open RAN systems.
