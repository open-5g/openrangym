Open Radio Access Networks (RANs) leverage disaggregated and programmable RAN functions and
open interfaces to enable closed-loop, data-driven radio resource management. This is performed
through custom intelligent applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), optimizing RAN
policy scheduling, network slicing, user session management, and medium access control, among
others. In this context, we have proposed dApps as a key extension of the O-RAN architecture
into the real-time and user-plane domains. Deployed directly on RAN nodes, dApps access data
otherwise unavailable to RICs due to privacy or timing constraints, enabling the execution of
control actions within shorter time intervals. In this paper, we propose for the first time a reference
architecture for dApps, defining their life cycle from deployment by the Service Management and
Orchestration (SMO) to real-time control loop interactions with the RAN nodes where they are
hosted. We introduce a new dApp interface, E3, along with an Application Protocol (AP) that
supports structured message exchanges and extensible communication for various service models.
By bridging E3 with the existing O-RAN E2 interface, we enable dApps, xApps, and rApps to
coexist and coordinate. These applications can then collaborate on complex use cases and employ
hierarchical control to resolve shared resource conflicts. Finally, we present and open-source a
dApp framework based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). We benchmark its performance in two real-time
control use cases, i.e., spectrum sharing and positioning in a 5th generation (5G) Next Generation
Node Base (gNB) scenario. Our experimental results show that standardized real-time control
loops via dApps are feasible, achieving average control latency below 450 microseconds and allowing
optimal use of shared spectral resources.
