short-description: Open Source Open RAN Simulation Platform

{% assign publications = site.data.publications %}

ns-O-RAN is the first open source simulation platform that combines a [functional 4G/5G protocol stack in ns-3](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave) with an [O-RAN-compliant E2 interface](https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/admin/repos/sim/ns3-o-ran-e2,general). 
This completes WIoT's OpenRAN Gym platform with a simulator that can enhance data collection and xApp testing capabilities, a key step toward enabling efficient and generic AI and ML solutions for Open RAN and 5G/6G systems.

ns-O-RAN has been designed and implemented to enable the integration of O-RAN software such as the O-RAN Software Community Near-RT RIC with large-scale 5G simulations based on [3GPP channel models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3389400.3389401) and a detailed modeling of the [full 3GPP RAN protocol stack](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8344116/). This allows data collection of RAN Key Performance Metrics (KPMs) at scale, in different simulated scenarios, and with different applications (e.g., multimedia streaming, web browsing, wireless virtual reality, etc). ns-O-RAN supports an O-RAN-compliant E2 interface and implements two E2 service models (E2SM), E2SM-Key Performance Metrics (KPM) monitoring and E2SM-RAN Control (RC), that enable a closed-loop control (for example, of traffic steering and mobility).

ns-O-RAN builds on [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) and the [ns3-mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave), which is developed and maintained by the [University of Padova](https://signet.dei.unipd.it) and NYU.
