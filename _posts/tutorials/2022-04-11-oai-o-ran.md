short-description: How to setup and use OpenAirInterface with a near-RT RIC
---

OpenAirInterface (OAI) is a 3GPP-compliant software implementation of the full 5G NR stack. In this tutorial, we show how OpenRAN Gym users can get started with deploying  an OAI gNB on Colosseum equipped with a standard compliant E2 agent for the E2AP component and custom Service Models based on protocol buffers, together with a Near-RT RIC and a sample xApp.

### xApp Components
#### Base xApp
This is a basic xapp (`base-xapp` in `xapp-oai` submodule) that subscribes to selected RAN parameters, receives periodic indications messages and sends control requests to update these parameters. The base xApp can communicate with the gNB by means of a RIC, or via direct socket communication.
{: .text-justify}

#### xApp SM Connector
This components (`xapp-sm-connector` in `xapp-oai` submodule) connects the xApp with the RIC. In downstream (from the xApp to the gNB), the connector receives our custom sm buffers to be encapsulated in E2AP messages and sent to the RIC. In upstream (from the gNB to the xApp), the connector retrieves custom Service Model (SM) buffers from E2AP to be sent to the xApp.

#### RIC Components 
See (ColO-RAN)[o-ran-frameworks/coloran] for a detailed description of the RIC components.


### Base Station Components
#### E2SIM
Similar to what the xApp SM Connector does, the E2SIM component (`e2sim` in `ocp-e2sim` submodule) encapsulates/decapsulates custom SM buffers that are to be sent or that are received from the gNB. It communicates with the gNB via UDP sockets.
{: .text-justify}

#### gNB Emulator
This component (in the `e2protobuf` submodule) is a simple gNB emulator to test custom SMs without running a real gNB. 

#### Protobuf Definitions
This repository contains our custom protobuf definitions (in the `oai-oran-protolib` submodule).

#### OpenAirInterface with xApp Agent
This component (`openairinterface5g` submodule) is a fork of OpenAirInterface with the addition of a custom xApp agent.

### Running the Base xApp with gNB Emulator 
Start by making a reservation on (Colosseum)[/experimental-platforms/colosseum] that includes `oai-ric` (the login credentials are `root`/`pass`).  For the following steps, we recommend using a terminal multiplexer such as `tmux` or `screen`.
{: .text-justify}

Start the gNB emulator. The emulated gNB is now waiting for incoming messages.

{% highlight bash %}
cd
e2protobuf/build/gnb_e2server_emu
{% endhighlight %}

Start the RIC:

{% highlight bash %}
cd
./start_ric_local_gnb.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Check that the following containers are running by using the command `docker ps`

{% highlight bash %}
e2term:ricindi
e2mgr:latest
e2rtmansim:latest
dbaas:latest
{% endhighlight %}

Start `e2sim`:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ocp-e2sim
./run_e2sim.sh
{% endhighlight %}

If in the `e2mgr` logs you see something like the following, it means that `e2sim` has successfully registered with the RIC:

{% highlight bash %}
{"crit":"INFO","ts":1666880119183,"id":"E2Manager","msg":"#RmrSender.Send - RAN name: >gnb_734_733_b5c67780 , Message type: 12002 - Successfully sent RMR message","mdc":>>>>{"time":"2022-10-27 14:15:19.183"}}
{% endhighlight %}

Start the base xApp container: 

{% highlight bash %}
cd
./start_xapp_container
{% endhighlight %}

Start the xApp SM Connector:

{% highlight bash %}
docker exec -it base-xapp-24 bash
cd ../xapp-oai/xapp-sm-connector/
./run_xapp.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Wait for the following lines to appear:

{% highlight bash %}
about to call xapp startup
Still waiting for indreq buf...
Opened control socket server on port 7000
{% endhighlight %}

The SM Connector is now ready to communicate with the base xApp. To run the xApp:

{% highlight bash %}
docker exec -it base-xapp-24 bash
cd ../xapp-oai/base-xapp/
python3 run_xapp.py
{% endhighlight %}

The base xApp will now receive periodic RIC Indication messages from the gNB. When an indication message is received, the xApp sends a control request to write the target RAN parameters with random data. This is how it normally looks like in the base xApp:
{: .text-justify}

{% highlight bash %}
Received  14  bytes
Recevied RIC indication response:
param_map {
  key: GNB_ID
  value: "8"
}
param_map {
  key: SOMETHING
  value: "1"
}

Sending RIC indication control with random data
printing built control message:
msg_type: CONTROL
ran_control_request {
  target_param_map {
    key: GNB_ID
    value: "5"
  }
  target_param_map {
    key: SOMETHING
    value: "3"
  }
}

Socket sent 18 bytes
{% endhighlight %}

The gNB will show something similar to the following:

{% highlight bash %}
Received 8 bytes
ran message id 2
Indication request message received
Indication request for 2 parameters:
        Parameter id 1 requested (a.k.a gnb_id)
        Parameter id 2 requested (a.k.a something)
Sending indication response
Sent 14 bytes, buflen was 14

-------------------------------
Received 18 bytes
ran message id 4
Control message received
Applying target parameter gnb_id with value 5
Applying target parameter something with value 3

-------------------------------
{% endhighlight %}

### Running the Base xApp with OAI gNB 
This requires a (Colosseum)[/experimental-platforms/colosseum] reservation with `oai-ric` and `eugenio-ran-dev`. The procedure is similar to the gNB emulator case, with the following differences:
{: .text-justify}

Start the RIC in the SRN running with `oai-ric`:

{% highlight bash %}
start_ric.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Start the gNB in the SRN running with `eugenio-ran-dev`:

{% highlight bash %}
./run_gnb.sh -t donor
{% endhighlight %}

In the same SRN, also start the `e2term`:
{% highlight bash %}
cd ocp-e2sim
./run_e2sim.sh
{% endhighlight %}
