short-description: How to setup Grafana and visualize plots from ns-3 simulation data
---

This tutorial demonstrates the process of visualizing ns-3 simulation data through Grafana. The following example involve extracting data from an ns-3 simulation and transmitting it to an InfluxDB server using Telegraf, in order for Grafana to collect and present the data on a dashboard, facilitating convenient analysis and interpretation. Four distinct dashboards have been designed to showcase the data derived from "cu-up," "cu-cp," and "du" files within the simulation container. The fourth dashboard specifically plots aggregated data points of interest. All the code is available in [this repository](https://github.com/wineslab/ns-o-ran-grafana).


#### Prerequisites
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is needed for this tutorial.

### Services and Ports
The following services will be opened thanks to Docker Compose:
##### Grafana
- URL: http://localhost:3000 
- User: admin 
- Password: admin 

##### Telegraf
- Port: 8125 UDP (StatsD input)

##### InfluxDB
- Port: 8086 (HTTP API)
- User: admin 
- Password: admin 
- Database: influx

### How to run the project
Start the stack with docker compose
```bash
$ docker compose up
```
Then open Grafana in a browser, using:
- URL: http://localhost:3000 
- User: admin 
- Password: admin 
and select a dashboard. On a terminal, run the python script

```bash
$ docker compose exec ns3 /bin/bash
$ cd ns3-mmwave-oran
$ python3 sim_watcher.py
```
This script is a watchdog that monitors the output files of the ns-3 simulation within the directory. The data generated by ns-3 is collected and sent to InfluxDB through Telegraf, which is then pulled by Grafana for visualization. 

On another terminal, run the ns3 simulation
```bash
$ docker compose exec ns3 /bin/bash
$ cd ns3-mmwave-oran
$ ./waf --run "scratch/scenario-zero.cc --enableE2FileLogging=1"
```
You may want to set the following options in the last command:
1. `--RngRun=n`, where n is a positive integer representing the seed for the pseudo-random number generator.
2. `--simTime=x`, where x is the simulation time (in seconds)

If you want, you can access the InfluxDB service with:
```bash
$ docker compose exec influxdb influx
> use influx # to select the database called "influx"
```
and visualize the metrics with:
```bash
> show measurements
```
or the entire tables with queries. For instance:
```bash
> select * from /L3servingSINR3gpp_cell_[0-9]/
```
show the tables containing SINR3 values measured at the network (L3) level for the 5G cells.


### Dashboards
In Grafana, go to 'Dashboard' then 'Manage'.

Four dashboards are available:

- Aggregated Metrics: currently showing only the number of UEs connected to each cell from the last update (histogram) and in all the simulation (heatmap).

- Control Plane (CU-CP) dashboard.

- User Plane (CU-UP) dashboard.

- Distributed Unit (DU) dashboard.

### Usage
Once everything is running correctly make sure the absolute time range on Grafana is set to "Last 5 minutes" so that data will appear as soon as it is sent. When data is visible you may want to change the absolute time range: "**From**" should be the timestamp of the first visible measurement, while "**To**" timestamp + simulation time.
