The O-RAN architecture enables flexible, data-driven management through RAN softwarization and xApps/rApps. However, latency and privacy concerns limit real-time RF monitoring.
To overcome these limitations, we adopt dApps, real-time microservices co-located with the RAN nodes, for spectrum classification. This tutorial guides you through deploying <strong>LibIQ</strong>, a modular and extensible C++/Python library specifically designed for RF signal analysis in O-RAN environments.
<strong>LibIQ</strong> provides a complete pipeline for reading, processing, visualizing, and labeling I/Q time-series data collected from wireless environments. It supports multiple input formats (e.g., binary, CSV, SigMF), and enables fast conversion of raw I/Q samples into structured time-series ready for classification. LibIQ also includes utilities to generate scatterplots, spectrograms and perform real-time spectrum analysis directly on-device.
A core feature of LibIQ is its built-in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, which achieves high accuracy predictions on various RF signal types. This makes it ideal for tasks like spectrum classification, anomaly detection, and signal fingerprinting in dynamic wireless networks.

#### Setting Up the gNB
Since this tutorial uses the dApp framework, please refer to the [dapps tutorial](https://openrangym.com/tutorials/dapps-oai) for detailed instructions on setting up the gNB.

#### Setting Up the dApp

**Prerequisites**: Make sure that `python3`, `hatch` and `libiq` are installed on your system.
```bash
  pip3 install hatch libiq
```
For more details on how to install `hatch` please refer to the [official website](https://hatch.pypa.io/).
A stable version of the `dapp` package should already be loaded on the official python repositories, thus these steps are intended to be conducted only to test the example Spectrum Classification dApp presented in this tutorial.

1. **Clone the dApp repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wineslab/dApp-library dApp
   cd dApp
   ```
2. **Build and install the Python package**
   ```bash
    hatch build
    pip3 install dist/*.tar.gz
   ```
3. **Run the dApp**  
   Start the dApp with the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 examples/spectrum_classification.py --control --link zmq --transport ipc --demo-gui --model <PATH_TO_MODEL>
   ```
   
   The options available for this example include:
   - **`--ota`**: Enable OTA configuration or specify if running on Colosseum.
   - **`--link`**: Specify the link layer to be used (default: **`zmq`**).
   - **`--transport`**: Specify the transport layer to be used (default: **`ipc`**).
   - **`--save-iqs`**: Enable data collection mode to save I/Q samples for offline analysis.
   - **`--control`**: Enable PRB blocking for spectrum management.
   - **`--energy-gui`**: Enable the Energy GUI through X11.
   - **`--iq-plotter-gui`**: Enable the I/Q Plotter GUI through X11.
   - **`--demo-gui`**: Enable the Demo GUI website.
   - **`--timed`**: Run for 5 minutes and exits.
   - **`--time-window`**: Number of input vectors to pass to the CNN model.
   - **`--input-vector`**: Number of I/Q samples per input vector.
   - **`--moving-avg-window`**: Window size (in samples) for the moving average used to detect energy peaks in the spectrum.
   - **`--extraction-window`**: Number of samples to retain after detecting an energy peak.
   - **`--model`**: Path to the CNN model file to be used.

#### Example Application: Spectrum Classification

The integration of LibIQ into a dApp that is presented in this tutorial is also available as a Linux container on Colosseum.
The name of the container is **`oai-dapp`** with password **`dapps`**.
To replicate this tutorial on Colosseum, create a reservation with at least three different nodes in the same order as presented here:
{: .text-justify}

- **`oai-5gcore-2024`**: Core for OAI that allows the identification and pairing of the UE to the network. Password for this container is **`pass`**.
- **`oai-dapp`**: our container that will act as a gNB with a dApp embedded; Password for this container is **`dapps`**. 
- **`cast`**: container from [[1]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3556564.3558243), used on this case as an external incumbent. Password for this container is **`cast123`**;

Once the reservation has been deployed, start a Radio Frequency (RF) scenario on Colosseum, e.g., scenario **`10011`** (All Paths 0 dB, 3.6 GHz as center frequency, 10 nodes max).

```bash
colosseumcli rf start 10011 -c
```


Run the OAI 5G Core-network as indicated in the [original tutorial](/tutorials/oai-tutorial):


```bash
cd oai-cn5g
docker compose up -d
```


Access the first `oai-dapp` container, create a `tmux` session and start the gNB operations with the aforementioned commands.
In the `openairinterface5g` folder, we have also a utility script perform the commands automatically:

```bash
cd ~/openairinterface5g
./run_oai.sh
```
Please edit this file and the configuration according to your needs.
Split the `tmux` session or open a new terminal and create a new window that will be dedicated to the dApp.
For Colosseum, we use a different noise floor threshold by not including the `--ota` parameter.

```bash
cd ~/dApp
taskset -ca 0-45 python3 examples/spectrum_classification.py --control --link zmq --transport tcp --demo-gui --model <PATH_TO_MODEL>
```

With the flag `--demo-gui`, you should be able to access a webpage on your browser that shows the I/Q samples sensed by the gNB and delivered by to the dApp.
To make the dApp faster the `taskset` utility can be used, please check the above command and the number of available cores on the SRN with `nproc`.

Since the sensed I/Qs are extracted from a reserved OFDM slot, the UE communication will not be shown in the web interface.

Finally, access the incumbent container (i.e., `cast`) and start a uniform noise with the command:

```bash
uhd_siggen --freq 3.6292e9 --samp-rate 1e6 --gain 20 -m 1 --uniform
```


The expected output is that the dApp, thanks to libiq, is able to detect the presence of a signal on the incumbent and classify it. The supported RF signal types are `No RFI`, `Radar`, `Jammer`, `Square` and `Triangular`
