short-description: Automated testing history of OAI on Colosseum
---

This page shows results from OpenAirInterface (OAI) iPerf3 tests run via [Colosseum](/experimental-platforms/colosseum) batch jobs. Tests are triggered automatically through Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines, such as <a href="https://jenkins-oai.eurecom.fr/job/RAN-Trigger-NEU-CI/" target="_blank">this</a>, which is hosted on the OAI Jenkins instance. Individual test results are analyzed through <a href="https://github.com/ztouchnetworks/openairinterface-automated-test-reports" target="_blank">this</a> automated report generation tool and stored on the above pipeline. Results of successful tests are saved in history files and used to compare new analyzed tests. A tabular version of the test history files is shown below (time is shown in UTC). This page is automatically updated as new tests are run.
